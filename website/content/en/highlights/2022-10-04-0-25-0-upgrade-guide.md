## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### Removal of VRL's modulo operator {#modulo-removal}

VRL's modulo operator (`%`) was deprecated in `0.24.0` and has now been removed. The `mod` function
can be used instead.

Before:

```coffee
5 % 2 == 1
```

After:

```cofee
mod(5, 2) == 1
```

### Deprecation Notices

#### Deprecation of VRL metadata functions {#metadata-function-deprecation}

Vector `0.25.0` has introduced a new metadata path syntax available in VRL which points
directly to event metadata. This means the metadata functions are no longer necessary and
will be removed in the future.
